    <h1>Have you ever made a pizza from scratch?</h1>
    <h2>Yeah but have you ever really thought about it?</h2>
    <h3>Like how if you put the sauce on first,
        before you make the base it doesnt work?</h3>
    <h4>Or, if you put the cheese on then the sauce its messed up too</h4>
    <p>
        Making a pizza is similar to coding, there are certain
        things we have to do first.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>make the pizza base</li>
        <li>add the tomato sauce</li>
        <li>add the toppings</li>
        <li>add the cheese</li>
        <li>cut</li>
        <li>serve</li>
    </ol>

    <h6>
        There is no order to toppings, I will list them here:
    </h6>

    <ul>
        <li>Pepperoni</li>
        <li>Peppers</li>
        <li>Mushrooms</li>
        <li>Pineapple <em>(only if you are crazy)</em></li>
        <li>Peppers <strong>(never green)</strong></li>
    </ul>
